Extract it to your NTFS stick.
!!!DANGER!!! Name your stick SONY.

After unpacking on the stick, your PS Classic is ready for use.

All BIOS files have been added to the mod, as well as all cover art for your future PSx Backup ROMS. Psx games come in the Transfer folder, depending on how many game backups you add from your collection, the process can take a little while. After this is done, the accepted games are no longer in the Transfer folder. These are now in a different folder with the appropriate cover.

Games that are still being transferred to your PC after checking again can be deleted. These are incorrect or not supported. Pay attention to PAL or NTSC

Your retro games intended for the PSx go in the Emus folder. A seperator folder must be created for each emulator.
