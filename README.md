All BIOS files have been added to the mod, as well as all cover art for your future PSx Backup ROMS. 
-
Psx games come in the Transfer folder, depending on how many game backups you add from your collection,
-
the process can take a little while. After this is done, the accepted games are no longer in the Transfer folder.
-
These are now in a different folder with the appropriate cover.
-
Games that are still being transferred to your PC after checking again can be deleted. These are incorrect or not supported. Pay attention to PAL or NTSC
-
Your Retro Games intended for the PSx go in the Emus folder.
-
A seperator folder must be created for each emulator.
