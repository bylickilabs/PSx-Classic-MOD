### Extract it to your NTFS stick.
|!!!ATTENTION!!!|
|---|
### Name your stick with SONY.
- After unpacking on the stick, your PS Classic is ready for use.
- All Cores files have been added (FULL ARCHIVE) to the mod, as well as all cover art for your future PSx Backup ROMS. 
- Psx games come in the Transfer folder, depending on how many game backups you add from your collection,
- the process can take a little while. After this is done, the accepted games are no longer in the Transfer folder.
- These are now in a different folder with the appropriate cover.
- Games that are still being transferred to your PC after checking again can be deleted. These are incorrect or not supported. Pay attention to PAL or NTSC
- Your Retro Games intended for the PSx go in the Emus folder.
- A seperator folder must be created for each emulator.
